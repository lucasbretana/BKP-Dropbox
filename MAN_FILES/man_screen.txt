**							What it does									**
*	Quando você se conecta a uma náquina Linux pelo putty (SSH), todas as operações são dependentes da sua sessão.
* Se você der um wget e fechar o putty, por exemplo, o download é interrompido. 
* E isso vale para tar, zip, make, etc. Qualquer atividade que estiver rodando.

* Uma maneira de deixa-la rodando é usando o nohup (see man_nohup.txt) but sometimes you wanna
* "reconect" to that program and keep seen the output, well in that case you can use screen.

* Long story short: you use it to let a process runnig on it self while you can
* disconnect from the server, then reconnect later and reconnect with the process, to see it's output.

**							How to use Screen							**
* Obs: At this point you should already be connect to the server, and have the screen installed (see help below).

* First: you start a screen virtual terminal by tapping
	$ screen
* Then you accept the prompt
* Now you have the virtual termial, you can run your taks normally. Once you are done starting, you can 
* disconnect of the terminal by using
	- Ctrl + a + d
* Obs: you can star as many screen as you SO allows you and later choose wich one to reattche.

* And also logoof of the server, if is that what you want
* Now, to reaatche to the screen, you must be connect to that computer again.

* You can see the screen runnig, by using
	$ screen -ls
* The result is all the screen runnig, with it's "name", that is composed by [PID].[terminal].[server]

* You can now reattach using
	$ screen -r [PID].[terminal].[server]

* To end a screen you just exit as normally, by typping
	- Ctrl + d
* Or using
	$ exit
