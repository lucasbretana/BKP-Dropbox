**    GApp Engine How To install    #

**    To work this example first you need to install the
**    GApp Engine libraries for your specific language and OS.
**    In this case I will consider that you will be working with
**    Java and GNU/Linux OS

Go to your work directory (where you want to download all the files, and keep the SDK) (see FAQ below [1])
 $ cd /PATH/YOU/CHOICE

Go to <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads?hl=pt_BR&&_ga=1.219788378.2137522117.1444139970#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Java>
and download the Google App Engine for Java.
Or just:
 $ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/appengine-sdks/featured/appengine-java-sdk-1.9.27.zip

Then unzip the file:
 $ unzip appengine-java-sdk-1.9.27.zip

Then export the bin path to your PATH system variable (see FAQ below [2])
 $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/appengine-java-sdk-1.9.27/bin/
It's really recommended to add this to your bashrc file (see FAQ below [3])
 - echo -e "## Used by GApp Engine \nexport PATH=$PATH:/path/to/appengine-java-sdk-1.9.27/bin/" >> $HOME/.bashrc

Bee sure to have java installed
 $ java -verion
 $ javac -version
Case you don't have it, see you SO forums and documentation to install the java
from repositories, or go to Java site, download and install java (JRE and JDK)

 $ : means that next command should be executed by you normal user, no need to root
 # : means that next command should be executed by root, or with sudo

[1] the default path for those things is /opt/create-a-folder-to-this-job/
You can create a folder with:
  # mkdir /opt/choose-the-name/
Remember that normally the owner from the folder /opt/ is root, so if you pretend
to use it with a regular user:
 	# chown -R you-user:your-user-or-group /opt/the-name-you-chossed/


[2] this variable is used for the system to know from where it should look for
executables, and binaries. It is changed in many places while the system loads
and runs. The one you own and can easily change is .bashrc in you home folder.

[3] doind this the variable will always be modified when the system starts,
a new termianl is opened, or the command:
 	$ source $HOME/.bashrc
it's executed, making it available "always".
