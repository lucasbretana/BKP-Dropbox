Extended pattern matching in BASH

Use “shopt -s extglob” to enable this feature.

?(pattern-list): Matches empty or one of the patterns
*(pattern-list): Matches empty or any number of occurrences of the patterns
+(pattern-list): Matches at least one occurrences of the patterns
@(pattern-list): Matches exactly one of the patterns
!(pattern-list): Matches anything EXCEPT any of the patterns

Exemplo: rm !(*@(.hs|.txt))

remove todos os arquivos exceto os que terminam em '.hs' ou '.txt'
