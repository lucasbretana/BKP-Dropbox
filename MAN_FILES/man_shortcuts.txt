# which allows the user to perform various low-level commands regardless 
# of the system's state. It is often used to recover from freezes, or to 
# reboot a computer without corrupting the filesystem. Its effect is 
# similar to the computer's hardware reset button (or power switch) but 
# with many more options and much more control.

# This key combination provides access to powerful features for software 
# development and disaster recovery. In this sense, it can be considered # a 
# form of escape sequence. Principal among the offered commands are means 
# to forcibly unmount file systems, kill processes, recover keyboard 
# state, and write unwritten data to disk. With respect to these tasks, 
# this feature serves as a tool of last resort.
# 
# The magic SysRq key cannot work under certain conditions, such as a 
# kernel panic or a hardware failure preventing the kernel from running 
# properly.
# 
# The combinations always assume the QWERTY keyboard layout; for example, 
# on a Dvorak Simplified Keyboard, the combination to shut the system down 
# uses the R key instead of O. Furthermore, some keyboards may not provide 
# a separate SysRq key. In this case, a separate PrtScr key should be 
present.
# 
# On some devices, notably laptops, the Fn key may need to be pressed to # use the magic SysRq key.

# Alt + SysRq (normally the Print) + ...
#  o - Shutdow the computer.
#  n - Resets the nice level (priority) of all high and realtime priority processes.
#  f - Calls oom_kill, which will kill a memory-hogging process.
#  r - Puts the keyboard into raw mode, taking control of it away from the X server.
#  e - Sends the terminate signal to all processes, asking them to end gracefully.
#  i - Sends the kill signal to all processes, forcing them to end immediately.
#  s - Flushes data from your cache to disk, syncronize the disk.
#  u - Remounts all file systems read-only.
#  b - Reboots your computer.

##			Cleanly Restarting Your System
#
# Used in sequence, some of these actions can be used to cleanly end 
# processes, flush data to disk, unmount all file systems, and restart 
# your computer. To perform this process, press and hold the Alt + SysRq 
# key combination and – while holding the Alt and SysRq keys down — type 
# the following keys in order, pausing for several seconds in between 
# each key:

# The mnemonic "Raising Elephants Is So Utterly Boring" is often used to 
# remember this sequence. Here’s what each key does:
