*** 	How to use the fstab file to mount a partition	***
Example:
	/dev/sda3       /media/Dados    ntfs-3g auto,users,exec,umask=000,rw,locale=pt_BR.UTF-8         0       0
The mount optins has a lot of setus that can be done, the ones that I already have to use are describe here:

]name[	]location[	]file-type[	]options[	0	0

]name[ - is the location of the partition, for more information see partitions on google

]location[ - is the location where the partition must be mounted, more comuns are /media and /mnt

]file-type[ - the most comun are ntfs(depecrated), ntfs-3g, swap, fat, ext4, ext3

]options[ - here it is a list of comun optins, there are more. See man page of mount: man mount

:: 	async  All I/O to the filesystem should be done asynchronously.  (See also the sync option.)

::	atime  Do not use the noatime feature, so the inode access time is controlled by kernel defaults.  See also the descriptions of the strictatime and relatime mount options.

::	noatime
              Do not update inode access times on this filesystem (e.g., for faster access on the news spool to speed up news servers).

::	auto   Can be mounted with the -a option, and is mounted on system boot.

::	noauto Can only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the -a option will not cause the filesystem to be mounted), also will only be mounted if clicked on ou or command mount.

:::	defaults - is "group" os options
              Use the default options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async.

              Note that the real set of all default mount options depends on kernel and filesystem type.  See the beginning of this section for more details.

::	dev    Interpret character or block special devices on the filesystem.

::	nodev  Do not interpret character or block special devices on the file system.

::	diratime
              Update directory inode access times on this filesystem.  This is the default.

::	nodiratime
              Do not update directory inode access times on this filesystem.

::	dirsync
              All  directory  updates  within  the  filesystem  should be done synchronously.  This affects the following system calls: creat, link, unlink, symlink, mkdir, rmdir, mknod and
              rename.

::	exec   Permit execution of binaries in that partion by it's owner.

::	noexec Do not permit direct execution of any binaries on the mounted filesystem.  (Until recently it was possible to run binaries anyway using a command like /lib/ld*.so /mnt/binary.
              This trick fails since Linux 2.4.25 / 2.6.0.)

::	group  Allow an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount the filesystem if one of his groups matches the group of the device.  This option implies the options nosuid and nodev (unless
              overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line group,dev,suid).

::	iversion
              Every time the inode is modified, the i_version field will be incremented.

::	noiversion
              Do not increment the i_version inode field.

::	suid   Allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take effect.

::	nosuid Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take effect.

::	silent Turn on the silent flag.

::	loud   Turn off the silent flag.

::	owner  Allow an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount the filesystem if he is the owner of the device.  This option implies the options nosuid and nodev (unless overridden by  sub‐
              sequent options, as in the option line owner,dev,suid).

::	remount
              Attempt  to  remount  an  already-mounted filesystem.  This is commonly used to change the mount flags for a filesystem, especially to make a readonly filesystem writable.  It
              does not change device or mount point.

              The remount functionality follows the standard way the mount command works with options from fstab.  This means that the mount command only doesn't read fstab (or  mtab)  when
              both the device and dir are specified.

              mount -o remount,rw /dev/foo /dir

              After this call all old mount options are replaced and arbitrary stuff from fstab is ignored, except the loop= option which is internally generated and maintained by the mount
              command.

              mount -o remount,rw  /dir

              After this call mount reads fstab (or mtab) and merges these options with the options from the command line (-o).

::	ro     Mount the filesystem read-only.

::	rw     Mount the filesystem read-write.

::	sync   All I/O to the filesystem should be done synchronously.  In the case of media with a limited number of write cycles (e.g. some flash drives), sync may cause life-cycle  short‐
              ening.

::	users  Allow  every  user  to  mount and unmount the filesystem.  This option implies the options noexec, nosuid, and nodev (unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option
              line users,exec,dev,suid).
