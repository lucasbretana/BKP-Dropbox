**    GApp Engine How To install    #

**    To work this example first you need to install the
**    GApp Engine libraries for your specific language and OS.
**    In this case I will consider that you will be working with
**    Java and GNU/Linux OS

Go to your work directory (where you want to download all the exemple)
 $ cd /PATH/YOU/CHOICE

Go to <https://console.developers.google.com/start/appengine?_ga=1.66103149.2123066311.1435170685>
and download the Google App Engine for Java.
Or just:
 $ wget https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-try-java/archive/master.zip

Install the Google App Engine SDK for Java, see my other tutorial, or go to "See"
section (below) and get the online tutorial

Bee sure that Java and Maven are installed
Bee sure to have Java installed
 $ java -verion
 $ javac -version
Case you don't have it, see you SO forums and documentation to install the java
from repositories, or go to Java site, download and install java (JRE and JDK)
Bee sure to have Maven installed
 $ mvn -v
Case you don't have it, see you SO forums and documentation to install the java
from repositories, or go to Maven site <https://maven.apache.org/>, download and
install Maven (version 3.2.1 or higher).

Go to the example directory
 $ cd /PATH/YOU/CHOICE/appengine-try-java-master

Let maven download all necessary jar libraries.
 $ mvn clean install

Create an online project, go to <https://console.developers.google.com/>

Use that command to put the app onlie:
 $ appcfg.py -A YOUR-PROJECT-CODE update app.yaml

This should open a browser, or at lest give you an URL so you can authorize the
APP, get a code and you shall put this code in the terminal where you execute the
last command.

Go to <YOUR-PROJECT-CODE.appspot.com> to test the example.
